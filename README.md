3D Navier-stokes solver for incompressible fluids using java 8 for regions including obstacles and surface.getGradient

Interested in this generally having seen water movement models in use at AMSA to predict the location of people that have fallen in the ocean for example.

Would like to document in java 8 (enjoying the conciseness of lambdas) a basic implementation of a [Navier-Stokes equations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations) solver for an incompressible fluid in 3D using the [pressure-correction method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure-correction_method).
